## **Project Title: NYC TLC Taxi Fare Estimation With Regression Model**

**Project Overview**

This project in collaboration with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) focuses on developing a regression model to estimate taxi fares based on a vast dataset of over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, which collectively handle approximately one million trips daily. Our aim is to harness this extensive data to provide insights and predictions for taxi fares in advance, ultimately enhancing the rider experience.

**Task**

Perform ***exploratory data analysis (EDA)*** on the TLC dataset.
Develop ***regression models to predict taxi fares.***
***Evaluate model performance*** and select the best approach.
***Provide recommendations for fare estimation improvements.***

**Tools and Libraries**

Jupyter Notebook,
Python,
NumPy,
pandas,
Matplotlib,
scikit-learn,
RandomForestClassifier,
XGBClassifier,
GridSearchCV

**Approach**

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Perform data ***cleaning***, handling ***missing values*** and ***outliers***.

Visualize data to gain insights.

Train regression models, including ***RandomForest*** and ***XGBoost***.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like ***Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*** and ***Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)***.

Optimize models using ***hyperparameter tuning.***

Select the best-performing model for fare estimation.

This project aims to provide the New York City TLC with a reliable regression model for taxi fare estimation, ensuring a seamless experience for passengers and drivers alike.
